during last year’s Super Bowl, 100 million US viewers were treated to a most unexpected sight in one of the commercial breaks. It was Andy Warhol doing nothing more than taking bites out of a Burger King Whopper – and adding the occasional bit of ketchup – for 45 seconds.
There was no music, no punchline, just a little, light rustling of the burger’s wrapper – in a slowly unfolding scene that culminated with the hashtag #EatLikeAndy. It was about as far removed as one could imagine from the big-budget ads traditionally shown during the Super Bowl.
Reaction on social media was swift, widespread and mostly containing the word “bizarre”. Why show a low-action clip from 1982, of an artist who died in 1987, at a sporting showcase in 2019? What financial sense did it make also – given that advertising slots at the Super Bowl are the most expensive in the world, costing $175,000 a second?
